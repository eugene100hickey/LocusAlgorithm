# LocusAlgorithm
This is the repo connected to the paper: The Locus Algorithm I: A technique for identifying optimised pointings for differential photometry at https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04582
It relies critically on access to SDSS using the url "http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr15/SkyserverWS/SearchTools/SqlSearch?"
Changing the ObjID on line 224 will regenerate the paper with a new star as target
